# Morse-Wavefunctions-in-1D
Exact analytical expressions, in terms of Laguerre polynomials, are available for vibrational wavefunctions of the Morse potential.
Numerical evaluation of such expressions is easy for small molecules. But for heavy molecules, numerical evaluation of the wavefunction
produces many errors and instabilities due to the large numbers involved. This program uses the asymptotic series expansion of the Gamma
functions (upto 8 terms) and simultaneous handling of the exponents to produce more acurate ans stable wavefunctions upto n~100.
